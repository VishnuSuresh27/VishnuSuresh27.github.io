## Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection
Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was a Russian photographer who pioneered color photography in the early 20th century. He took thousands of color pictures, each a series of three exposures of a scene onto a glass plate using red, green, and blue filters. Each of these plates have been digitized as a single image containing the different plates aligned vertically on each other, with the blue plate on top, the green plate in the middle, and the red plate on the bottom.

The goal of this project is to take the digitized versions of those glass plates and to employ image processing techniques to align the plates to produce a full color photograph with as few artifacts as possible.
